# Phishing_Detection

**Overview**

This project is a machine learning-based phishing detection system that classifies URLs as either phishing or legitimate. It extracts features from URLs, applies ML models, and provides real-time predictions with explanations.

**Features**

- URL classification (phishing or legitimate)
- Machine Learning-based detection (Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Learning)
- Feature extraction & selection (Lexical, Host-based, and Network features)

**Model Training**

- **Dataset**: Collected from PhishTank and OpenPhish.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted lexical, DNS, and IP-based features.
- **Model Selection**: Used Random Forest, XGBoost, and Machine Learning models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
Accuracy: 97.51%,
Precision: 97.39%,
Recall: 98.1%
